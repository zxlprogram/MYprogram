	-left side: the layer managing

## Possibly bug
	-some java.awt exception happend in linux operating system
	
## lacking feature
	-drag the object with X/Y axis(point p move if [mouseX-surface.getcertain.getX>mouseY-surface.getcertain.getY] than move(mouseX,p.Y),else move(p.X,mouse.Y))
	-better color choosing UX
