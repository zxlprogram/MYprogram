## feature description
	-KeyEvent ctrl+C: copy the choosing surface
	-KeyEvent up/right: make the choosing surface bigger(if there have surface have been choosed)
	-KeyEvent down/left: make the choosing surface smaller(if there have surface have been choosed)
	-keyEvent delete: delete the choosing surface(if there have surface have been choosed) or delete the highest layer surface
	-KeyEvent ctrl+Z: undo the step
	-KeyEvent ctrl+Y: redo the step
	-KeyEvent ctrl+S: save the file
	-KeyEvent ctrl+A: select all
	-ctrl+MouseWheelEvent: zoom in/out
	-ctrl+MouseClickedEvent: choosed multy surface or point
	-MouseEvent left: when pressed, choosing surface will became null if the mouse didn't in any surface,otherwise choosing surface will became the highest layer surface, when dragged, it will check if the choosing point were exist,if it were exist than the point will follow the mouse; otherwise it will check if the choosing surface were exist, if it were exist than the surface will follow the mouse;if nothing were been choosed, we will translation All Object(it look like canvas translation but we actually move all surfaces)
	-MouseEvent right: change the color for choosing surface
	-Color changing: the textfield used to enter RGB, it is only allowed to enter the number which between 0 and 1, if the format is wrong, it will show the dialog to announce the error, you must enter the number again
	-dragging file: let the saving data added in your painter
	-Core: this app GUI is base on java swing
	-left side: the layer managing
	-up side: the tool list

## Possibly bug
	[linux]
	no current bug

	[windows]
	no current bug

## lacking feature
	-trying work the program in Java 8 and lower java runtime enviornment
	-.png .svg support
	-the unit spacing to do zoom in/out
	
## Requirements
	-Java devolopment kit(JDK) 25
	-Windows 10+ or ubuntu

## download
	-https://github.com/zxlprogram/MYprogram/tree/master/Painter
	
## execution
	main app:
		-cd MYprogram/Painter/bin
		-java testing.Main
	
	browser:
		1.open cmd, path to the folder which have painterBrowser.jar
		2. .\painterBrowser.jar <your_painter_file_name.txt>
			exp: ".\painterBrowser.jar C:\Users\user\desktop\file.vecf"
			
		or double click the jar file to open it, drag the file to the browser to check the file in browser
	
## Custom file protocol
	-file format: .vecf
	-at first line we have three number for scale, offsetX, offsetY, and below next line, it record for all of the PainterObj, for each PainterObj, we have a vocabilary, N points and a color,first vocabilary descripted the PaintObj class; every points have two doubles and color have three, each point's format:"X Y ",and than, " C " were followed, at last, Color format:"R G B" will followed behind, if the vocabilary at first word is G: means it is a group, and then at that line will have some PainterObj descripted and splited by ","
