	-keyEvent delete: delete the choosing surface(if there have surface have been choosed) or delete the highest layer surface
	-MouseEvent left: when pressed, choosing surface will became null if the mouse didn't in any surface,otherwise choosing surface will became the highest layer surface, when dragged, it will check if the choosing point were exist,if it were exist than the point will follow the mouse; otherwise it will check if the choosing surface were exist, if it were exist than the surface will follow the mouse;if nothing were been choosed, we will translation All Object(it look like canvas translation but we actually move all surfaces)
	-MouseEvent right: change the color for choosing surface
	-Color changing: the textfield used to enter RGB, it is only allowed to enter the number which between 0 and 1, if the format is wrong, it will show the dialog to announce the error, you must enter the number again
