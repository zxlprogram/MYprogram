	[windows]
	no current bug

## lacking feature
	-drag the object with X/Y axis(point p move if [mouseX-surface.getcertain.getX>mouseY-surface.getcertain.getY] than move(mouseX,p.Y),else move(p.X,mouse.Y))
	-better color choosing UX
	-linux version
	-trying work the program in Java 8 and lower java runtime enviornment
	
## Requirements
	-Java 25
	-Windows 10+

## Custom file protocol
	-at first line we have three number for scale, offsetX, offsetY, and below next line, it record for all of the surface, for each surface, we have N points and a color, every points have two doubles and color have three, each point's format:"X Y ",and than, " C " were followed, at last, Color format:"R G B" will followed behind
